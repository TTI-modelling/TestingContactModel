    "We now extend the individual level contact tracing process with daily contact testing. The idea is that instead of traced contacts quarantining, they will instead test themselves daily using lateral flow tests. This can allow for higher levels of adherence, since the contact tracing process is less burdensome. In addition, this will allow for the detection of asymptomatic chains of transmission and potentially detecting cases earlier in their infection. Household contacts are a special case, and we consider several different household contact policies. We also include models of how test sensitivity varies over time, for both lateral flow and pcr tests."
